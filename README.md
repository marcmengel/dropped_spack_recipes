These are recipes for packages which I was considering distributing via 
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack)
at some point, and so tried building them under spack with these
recipes.  Many have been decided to be distributed vi RPM's instead,
or just dropped altogether, or are dependencies of such decisions.

Anyhow, if you are considering building any of these under Spack,
you are welcome to snag these as a starting point; some, like htcondor,
have another dozen or so dependencies you might want to add.
